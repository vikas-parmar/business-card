## What I learn from this project
- React Components: Creating reusable components and use them to build a dynamic and interactive card display.
- CSS Styling: Styling components using CSS in React.
- Deployment: How to deploy React project to a hosting service or platform.

## Optimizations
When I improve this repository, I'll add some more features such as downloading or sharing the card.
I want to include a form where users can input their personal and professional information (such as their name, title, profile, contact information, and social media handles), and then generates a stylized business card based on that information.
